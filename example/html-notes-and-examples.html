<!-- HTML NOTES
	DIV vs SPAN
		<div></div> is block element (defaultly make a new line) 
		<span></span> is inline element (defaultly not make a newline)
		=================
	SEMANTIC TAGS (BLOCKS)
		<header></header>
			A tag for the header of the page (e.g. company info etc)
		<nav></nav>
			A tag for the navigation for the website
		<section></section>
			A tag marking the sections of the pages, may contain some related articles
		<article></article>
			A tag containing the article of the page
		<aside></aside>
			A tag containing links to side topics
		<footer></footer>
			A tag for the footer of the page (e.g. copyright)
		=================
	CHARACTER ENTITY REFERENCES
		<						&lt;
		>						&gt;
		&						&amp;
		Â©						&copy;
		nonBreakingSpace		&nbsp;
		""						&quot; (for less than UTF-8 char set)
		=================
	LINKS <a> ATTRIBUTES
		href is the link or part(#idAttr or #nameAttr) direction
		title is for the mouseover information
		target is defining the target area to open the link (_blank to open a new tab)
		=================
	IMAGE <img> ATTRIBUTES
		alt is to contain information/caption when mouseover, to help one with visual impairment
		=================

<!-- CSS NOTES 
	SELECTORS COMBINATION
		sel1, sel2 = rules affect two or more selectors
		sel.clName = every sel element that has clName attribute value of class
		sel1 > sel2 = every sel2 that is a direct child of sel1 (not a grandchild lol)
		sel1 sel2 = every sel2 that is a descendant of the sel1
		sel1 + sel2 = the next sel2 after the sel1
		sel[attr=value] = every sel that has the attribute value
		* = everything
	PSEUDO-CLASS SELECTOR
		selector:pseudo-class
			:link 			only selects the unvisited link
			:visited 		only selects the visited link
			:hover 			only applies when mouse hover
			:active 		only applies when clicked
			:nth-child(x) 	only selects the x-th child of a sel
			:nth-of-type(x)	only selects the x-th sel 
	CONFLICT RESOLUTION
		Origin (right one is more significant)
			Stylesheet > Header > Attribute
		Inheritance (right one is more significant)
			Parent > child	
		Specificity
			Element > Class/Pseudo/Attr > ID > Style Attribute
		ORDER
			!important = automatically overwrites (but avoid it please! May mess things up)
	FLOAT AND CLEAR POSITIONING
		Float: (top/bottom/left/right)
			Objects will float and ignore the regular document order. May cause overlapping. (use clear to stop overlaps). Don't have vertical margin collapse
		Clear: (top/bottom/left/right)
			Objects will not allow other object to float in the selected direction.
	MEDIA QUERIES
		@media (media-feature) <and/,(or)> (media-feature2, if necessary){
			if true, styles here are applied
		}
		media-feature
			(max-width: ..px) {..} <<MOST-COMMON
			(min-width: ..px) {..} <<MOST-COMMON
			(orientation: ..) {..}
			screen {..}
			print {..}
		Application
			Base Styles (color, pictures, etc)
			first media query
			second media query, make sure there's no overlapping logics
 		Browser size (width in this case) is divided into 12 parts. The content's width may vary from 1 to 12 column(s) wide, so that the width of the item is x*8.33%. Don't forget to include the padding in sizing or use the border-box settings.
		>> Nested Grids
			12 grids inside a section of the larger grids. (12 grids in a 4-grid wide element)
		To ease things up use a class to assign the content's width and style it by the width. You probably want to make different class for a different size of the media.
		Some phone browser zoomed out the content of the web so it fits on the website. Since the CSS has been styled to have responsive design, the zoom-out can be turned off by using <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">, this way the browse will use the device-width data as the width.
	BOOTSTRAP
		>> Too Big << Selective download
		>> Grid System
			<div class="container">
				<div class="row"> //Has negative margin, so things will align with other content
					<div class="col-xx-x">..</div>
					..
				</div>
				..
			</div>
	EXTRA
		..For links <a> or any both inline and block element, you can use display: block in CSS to make it as a block.
		..To apply a size to the whole block, use box-sizing: border-box (so instead of apply the size to the content box only, you apply it to the whole box (Border+Padding+Content)). Box sizing is not inherited, so to apply it to the whole document, use * selector.
		..Side margins are cumulative, while top-bottom margins are collapsing (the bigger one wins), except for the elements with float properties
		..To maintain a content that don't fit the box size, you can use overflow which has some values like auto (puts a scrollbar), scroll (always shows a scrollbar), hidden (clip the excessive content), visible (let the content overflow)
		..Relative positioning doesn't obstruct the normal doocument flow (the next object's position is not changed). Its position is moved from its original position. Its position will also affect the contained element's positioning (so that the contained object's position will be relative to this container)
		..Absolute positioning obstruct/is removed from the normal document flow, so other object's position will be changed too. If it's not contained in a relative positioned element, the object will be placed relative to the relative positioned ancestor (if there isn't any, automatically relative to the html tag)
