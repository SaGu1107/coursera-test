<!-- HTML NOTES
	DIV vs SPAN
		<div></div> is block element (defaultly make a new line) 
		<span></span> is inline element (defaultly not make a newline)
		=================
	SEMANTIC TAGS (BLOCKS)
		<header></header>
			A tag for the header of the page (e.g. company info etc)
		<nav></nav>
			A tag for the navigation for the website
		<section></section>
			A tag marking the sections of the pages, may contain some related articles
		<article></article>
			A tag containing the article of the page
		<aside></aside>
			A tag containing links to side topics
		<footer></footer>
			A tag for the footer of the page (e.g. copyright)

	CHARACTER ENTITY REFERENCES
		<						&lt;
		>						&gt;
		&						&amp;
		Â©						&copy;
		nonBreakingSpace		&nbsp;
		""						&quot; (for less than UTF-8 char set)
		=================
	LINKS <a> ATTRIBUTES
		href is the link or part(#idAttr or #nameAttr) direction
		title is for the mouseover information
		target is defining the target area to open the link (_blank to open a new tab)
		=================
	IMAGE <img> ATTRIBUTES

<!-- CSS NOTES 
	SELECTORS COMBINATION
		sel1, sel2 = rules affect two or more selectors
		sel.clName = every sel element that has clName attribute value of class
		sel1 > sel2 = every sel2 that is a direct child of sel1 (not a grandchild lol)
		sel1 sel2 = every sel2 that is a descendant of the sel1
		sel1 + sel2 = the next sel2 after the sel1
		sel[attr=value] = every sel that has the attribute value
		* = everything
	PSEUDO-CLASS SELECTOR
		selector:pseudo-class
			:link 			only selects the unvisited link
			:visited 		only selects the visited link
			:hover 			only applies when mouse hover
			:active 		only applies when clicked
			:nth-child(x) 	only selects the x-th child of a sel
			:nth-of-type(x)	only selects the x-th sel 
	CONFLICT RESOLUTION
		Origin (right one is more significant)
			Stylesheet > Header > Attribute
		Inheritance (right one is more significant)
			Parent > child	
		Specificity
			Element > Class/Pseudo/Attr > ID > Style Attribute
		ORDER
			!important = automatically overwrites (but avoid it please! May mess things up)
	FLOAT AND CLEAR POSITIONING
		Float: (top/bottom/left/right)
			Objects will float and ignore the regular document order. May cause overlapping. (use clear to stop overlaps). Don't have vertical margin collapse
		Clear: (top/bottom/left/right)
			Objects will not allow other object to float in the selected direction.
	MEDIA QUERIES
		@media (media-feature) <and/,(or)> (media-feature2, if necessary){
			if true, styles here are applied
		}
		media-feature
			(max-width: ..px) {..} <<MOST-COMMON
			(min-width: ..px) {..} <<MOST-COMMON
			(orientation: ..) {..}
			screen {..}
			print {..}
		Application
			Base Styles (color, pictures, etc)
			first media query
			second media query, make sure there's no overlapping logics
 		Browser size (width in this case) is divided into 12 parts. The content's width may vary from 1 to 12 column(s) wide, so that the width of the item is x*8.33%. Don't forget to include the padding in sizing or use the border-box settings.
		>> Nested Grids
			12 grids inside a section of the larger grids. (12 grids in a 4-grid wide element)
		To ease things up use a class to assign the content's width and style it by the width. You probably want to make different class for a different size of the media.
		Some phone browser zoomed out the content of the web so it fits on the website. Since the CSS has been styled to have responsive design, the zoom-out can be turned off by using <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">, this way the browse will use the device-width data as the width.
	BOOTSTRAP
		>> Too Big << Selective download
		>> Grid System
			<div class="container">
				<div class="row"> //Has negative margin, so things will align with other content
					<div class="col-xx-x">..</div>
					..
				</div>
				..
			</div>
	EXTRA
		..For links <a> or any both inline and block element, you can use display: block in CSS to make it as a block.
		..To apply a size to the whole block, use box-sizing: border-box (so instead of apply the size to the content box only, you apply it to the whole box (Border+Padding+Content)). Box sizing is not inherited, so to apply it to the whole document, use * selector.
		..Side margins are cumulative, while top-bottom margins are collapsing (the bigger one wins), except for the elements with float properties
		..To maintain a content that don't fit the box size, you can use overflow which has some values like auto (puts a scrollbar), scroll (always shows a scrollbar), hidden (clip the excessive content), visible (let the content overflow)
		..Relative positioning doesn't obstruct the normal doocument flow (the next object's position is not changed). Its position is moved from its original position. Its position will also affect the contained element's positioning (so that the contained object's position will be relative to this container)
		..Absolute positioning obstruct/is removed from the normal document flow, so other object's position will be changed too. If it's not contained in a relative positioned element, the object will be placed relative to the relative positioned ancestor (if there isn't any, automatically relative to the html tag)

<!-- JS NOTES
	JAVASCRIPT TYPES
		> Object Types
		  Constructed data structure (multi name-and-value pair)
		> Primitive Types
		  >> Boolean (TRUE or FALSE)
		  >> Undefined (Defined, but has no value set)
		  >> Null (Signifies lack of value/Value set to Null)
		  >> Number (Double-precision 64-bit floating point)
		  >> String
		  >> Symbol
	BOOLEAN VALUE OF TYPES
		null 		FALSE
		undefined 	FALSE
		0 			FALSE
		""			FALSE
		//in JS || (OR) returns true on the first true
		//for string validation (not empty), X = X||something
		//if there's non Boolean return process in a condition, the process is still done 
	OBJECT
		Object creation
			1. var objectName = new object();
			2. var objectName = {
				property1: value1, 
				..,
				"property name with space": valueX,
			    propertyN: valueN
			   };
			3. function ConstructorName (argument){
				this.xx = xx; (this refer to ConstructorName as an object)
			}

				var objectName = new ConstructorName(az); //This will make a new object
		Object.property1.property2
			>property1 must be defined first as a new object
			>property2 doesn't really need to be defined
		Calling/Defining An Object
			Object.propertyNameWithoutSpaceOnly
			Object["property name with space"]
	FUNCTIONS
		> Function is an object
		> If a function has a function in its scope, the input parameter can be passed via the variable that contain the return value of the function, e.g.: (universal function referral)
			function makeMultiplier(multiplier){
				function myFunc(x){
					return multiplier*x;
				};

				return myFunc;
			};
			
			var multiplyBy5 = makeMultiplier(5);
			console.log(multiplyBy5(1000));

			Notes:
				myFunc(x) is defined inside makeMultiplier(multiplier).
				var multiplyBy5 contains the result of makeMultiplier(5)
				x can be passed by using
					multiplyBy5(x);
				which will return a value of the 5*1000;
		> If a function is called into console without having a parameter spac "()", the console will print the function as a string
		> Functions can be passed as an argument, by declaring its container variable (e.g. multiplyBy5) as a parameter value, in this case without "()", e.g.:
			function doOperation(x,operation){
				return operation(x);
			}.
			var result = doOperation(1000, multiplyBy5);
			console.log(result);
		> Passing Var by Values vs by Ref
			>> By Value (Primitive Type)
			   a is copied to b. Any changes in b/a doesn't change the value in a/b.
			   //Copy value to a new memory address 
			>> By Ref (Object Type)
			   a is copied to b. Any changes in b/a changes the value in a/b
 			   //Copy the address it's pointing to a new memory address
		> If the arguments given to a function are more than needed, the function only uses the required one. (the rest is abandoned)
		> Function Constructor is used to create a new object. Usually named with a UPPERCASE on its first letter. The function MUST returns nothing. Creates a new object when 
			var objName = new Constructor
		> prototype is a property of an object (from the constructor), so that a function can return a value multiple times for different objects by only creating one function
		> "this" in JS refers to the the object where it is declared. 
			//In inner function (function inside a function Constructor) where you use it with a variable
				var x = function (){
					something
				}, 
			"this" does not refer to the Constructor, instead to the window (global) <some refer this as a bug>. To handle this (in case the inner function change a property in the object), pass the variable this by reference (automatically, since its an object) to a variable (self), so to refer to the Constructor property, instead of using "this", use "self"
	ARRAY
		> Creating Array
		 1. var arrayName = new Array();
			arrayName[index] = value; // can be primitive or object or even function
		 2.	var arrayName = [value1, value2, value3];
		> Has a property of length
		> Basically an object with a prop (property) of a sequential number
	NAMESPACE
		> Be careful when using two or more script files that has a same global scope name variable. The older value will be overwritten by the later value of the global scope variable. To avoid this, a value can be defined/assigned inside a function execution contexr or as a property of an object. OR by using IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)
		> IIFE
			(function (arg){
				//function body here
			})(argValue);
		> Exposing a variable to window
			function (window){
				//function body here
				window.variable = variable;
			})
